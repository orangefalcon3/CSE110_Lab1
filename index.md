## Personal Introduction
Hello, my name is Akhilan Gurumoorthy. I am a student at ~~Arnold O. Beckman High School~~ University of California, San Diego. I am majoring in **Computer Science**, and I am a 2<sup>nd</sup> year student.

## Programming Introduction
I spent much of my high school career knowing that I wanted to be a programming but unsure of what I wanted to do specifically in the vast field of computer science. I am still not completely sure, but a quote from my dad has stuck with my since he said it.
> The way we talk to computers is unnatural. We talk to humans through words and body language, but we talk to computers through a keyboard.

This quote opened my eyes to everything that computer science coould still be. There was still so much room for improvement, and this quote piqued my interest in Natural Language Processing, or *NLP* for short. 

## Programming Experience
I have some programming experience across a variety of fields. As previously mentioned, I have worked in the field of machine learning, but I also have heavy experience in app development. I have had to deal with my fair share of `npm install` and `git commit`, and I hope to do more of this in the future, as well. You can find a list of all of the programming languages that I know at [this markdown page](linked_files/known_languages.md).

My current favorite programming experience is the research lab that I am a part of. I am working in a machine learning robotics laboratory, and the professor that I am doing research under is [Professor Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/).

## [My Personal Passion](https://www.denverbroncos.com/)
I am an avid sports fan, across many different sports. For me to get truly interested in a sport, I pick a team to root for, and funnily enough, very few of these teams are local teams. There are six sports in which I have a favorite team, and this is the ranking of how big of a fan I am of these teams.

1. Denver Broncos - NFL (Football)
2. Boston Celtics - NBA (Basketball)
3. San Diego Padres - MLB (Baseball)
4. Chelsea FC - PL (Soccer)
5. Chennai Super Kings - IPL (Cricket)
6. Mercedes-AMG Racing Team - F1 (Racing)

The top four teams are the teams that I am an especially big fan of. For these four teams, I could talk for hours about their history and how I feel about their future.

My dream job is to join the front office of an NFL team, and I want to find a way to integrate software engineering into that field.

## Goals for the School Year
I have a few goals for the 2022-23 school year, and they are listed below.
- [x] Conduct Research in Machine Learning
- [ ] Get an Internship for the Summer
- [x] Get Back into Playing Basketball Consistently
- [ ] Climb a V4
